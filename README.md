# Self-Balancing Project : FRA501 Robotics DevOps
This project is part of the FRA501 Robotics DevOps course of third-year students at the Institute of Field Robotics (FIBO), King Mongkutâ€™s University of Technology Thonburi (KMUTT) to simulate the work system of a **Self-Balancing Robot** with **2 reaction wheels** on Gazebo program with ROS2.

## **Objective**
1) To simulate the work system of a **Self-Balancing Robot** with 2 reaction wheels on Gazebo program with ROS2.
2) To learn how to setup the environment for simulating robot operations.

## **Package**

![sb drawio](https://github.com/kkwxnn/self_balancing/assets/122891621/83433a7b-9782-4744-9514-3532ae13acd2)


### **Config**
- collision_parameters.yaml
- controller_parameters.yaml
- dynamics_parameters.yaml
- kinematics_parameters.yaml
- visual_parameters.yaml

### **sb_robot**
- properties.xacro
- manipulator.xacro
- robot.xacro
- motor_controller.gazebo.xacro
- imusensor.xacro

### **script**
- sb_motor_controller.py
  - **Imu_sensor_callback(msg)**: This function gets orientation, angular velocity, and linear acceleration from the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensor.
  - **quaternion_to_euler(q)**: This function is for converting quaternion, which is a 4-element vector to Euler angles, which are three angles that represent the rotation about the intrinsic axes (roll, pitch, yaw).
  - **Controller()**: This function controls motor velocity to be at an orientation that makes the center of mass (CM) be above the Pivot Point utilizing PID control from this equation. Joint 0 is for control X-axes and joint 1 is for control Y-axes.

## **Installation**
Step 1: Clone the repository to the src directory of your workspace. You must unzip and put each folder in the src directory. 
```
cd ~/[your_workspace]/src
git clone https://github.com/kkwxnn/self_balancing.git
```

Step 2: Run rosdep install to install dependencies
```
rosdep update
rosdep install --from-paths src -y --ignore-src
```

Step 3: Build "self_balancing" in your workspace.
```
cd ~/[your_workspace]
colcon build 
source install/setup.bash
```

## **Testing out "self_balancing"**
Run launch file in your workspace

```
ros2 launch self_balancing sb_robot_spawn_launch.py
```
